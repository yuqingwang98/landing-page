They give me a meaning of life, and I hope this page brings you joy too.

The webpage is broken down into three sections:
- Overview

Today's date is visible at the top of the page, enabled by DOM manipulation.

## Skills Applied

- Lists

## Reflection
- Practiced linking JavaScript to HTML
- Learnt how to retrieve the current date and format it
- It takes a lot of practice to use Flexbox properly, playing with css on chrome inspection helped a lot
- Fixed the issue with google fonts not showing up by removing the https part
